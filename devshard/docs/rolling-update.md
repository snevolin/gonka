# Rolling Update Plan: versiond + devshardd

Goal (operator requirement):

> Roll out a **new binary under the same version name** (name stays, e.g.
> `v0.2.13`, only the `sha256` changes) such that:
> 1. every request already accepted by the previous instance is allowed to
>    finish — we do **not** kill an instance while it is still processing;
> 2. we stop/kill the old instance **only after** the new one is ready and
>    reachable;
> 3. once the new instance is reachable we route **new** requests to it, while
>    the old instance keeps **draining** its in-flight requests.

This document has two parts:

1. **Part 1 — versiond (detailed).** A concrete, blue/green + drain design for
   the existing `versioned/` supervisor and `devshardd` child (governance binary
   swap), plus a separate **`versiond-router` host-evacuation** track for HA
   (§1.7–§1.8).
2. **Part 2 — Kubernetes (high level).** A non-detailed sketch of how the same
   guarantees map onto a future K8s deployment.

## 0. Where we are today (baseline)

### versiond supervisor

`versiond` polls the oracle every `VERSIOND_POLL_INTERVAL` (30s default) and
reconciles desired vs. running children.

- Routing is an in-process reverse proxy keyed by the version prefix:
  `/<version>/...` → `localhost:<port>`. The route table is an
  `atomic.Value` holding `map[versionName]host:port`.

```15:57:versioned/internal/proxy/proxy.go
func Handler(routes *atomic.Value) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		path := strings.TrimPrefix(r.URL.Path, "/")
		parts := strings.SplitN(path, "/", 2)
		...
		routeMap := routes.Load().(map[string]string)
		target, ok := routeMap[version]
		...
		p := &httputil.ReverseProxy{ ... FlushInterval: -1 }
		p.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}
```

- Same-name/new-sha is detected in `Reconcile` and handled by `downloadAndSwap`:
  it downloads the new binary first, then **stops the old child and starts the
  new one on the same port**.

```392:419:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
// downloadAndSwap downloads the new binary, then atomically replaces the old one.
// The old process is stopped only after the new binary is on disk.
func (m *Manager) downloadAndSwap(ctx context.Context, v oracle.Version, sha string, old *child) error {
	dlErr := m.downloadBinary(ctx, v, sha)
	...
	// Stop old process after new binary is on disk.
	old.cancel()
	waitForChild(old, 5*time.Second)

	m.mu.Lock()
	delete(m.downloading, v.Name)
	delete(m.processes, v.Name)
	m.startChild(ctx, v)
	m.mu.Unlock()
	return nil
}
```

- A child is only added to the route table when its status is `running`, and a
  child reaches `running` after a **TCP-accept** probe (not a readiness probe):

```576:583:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
		// Wait for the child to start accepting connections before routing traffic.
		if !waitForPort(ctx, c.port, 10*time.Second) {
			slog.Warn("child did not start listening in time, routing anyway", "version", c.version.Name)
		}
		m.mu.Lock()
		c.status = statusRunning
		m.rebuildRoutes()
		m.mu.Unlock()
```

- On stop, the child is sent `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after 5s
  (`cmd.WaitDelay`), and `waitForChild` only waits 5s.

```559:563:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
		cmd.Cancel = func() error {
			return cmd.Process.Signal(syscall.SIGTERM)
		}
		cmd.WaitDelay = 5 * time.Second // SIGKILL after 5s if SIGTERM didn't work
```

### devshardd child

- HTTP server (Echo) exposes `GET /healthz` that always returns `ok` — this is
  a **liveness** signal, not a readiness or drain signal.

```24:24:devshard/cmd/devshardd/server.go
	e.GET("/healthz", func(c echo.Context) error { return c.String(http.StatusOK, "ok") })
```

- On `SIGTERM` it does `server.Shutdown(ctx)` with a **5s** grace window, so any
  request longer than ~5s (long SSE `/chat/completions`, validation) is cut off.

```306:321:devshard/cmd/devshardd/app.go
	cancel()

	shutdownCtx, shutdownCancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
	defer shutdownCancel()
	_ = a.server.Shutdown(shutdownCtx)
```

- It already tracks in-flight work via a Prometheus gauge `devshard_inflight`
  (by stage), so the supervisor has a data source for "is this child idle?".

```54:57:devshard/observability/metrics_lifecycle.go
	inflight = prometheus.NewGaugeVec(prometheus.GaugeOpts{
		Name: "devshard_inflight",
		Help: "In-flight devshard operations by stage.",
	}, []string{"stage"})
```

### Gap analysis vs. the requirement

| Requirement | Today | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| New ready before traffic | TCP-accept only, then routed | No real readiness gate |
| New reachable → route new requests to it | Route swapped after start | OK at proxy layer (per-request reverse proxy) |
| Old finishes in-flight | `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL` after 5s | **Old is killed, not drained** |
| Don't kill old until idle | `waitForChild(old, 5s)` | **No idle wait** |
| Same name, new binary | stop-then-start on **same port** | **Brief 404 gap; old + new can't coexist** |

The single blocking fact: to keep the old child alive **while** the new child is
already ready, both must run **at the same time, on different ports**. The
current swap is stop-then-start on one port, so the two can never overlap.

---

## Part 1 — versiond rolling update (detailed)

### 1.1 Design summary

Convert the in-place swap into a **blue/green + drain** swap inside versiond:

```
poll detects same name, new sha
        │
        ▼
download new binary to disk (old keeps running, already exec'd in memory)
        │
        ▼
start NEW child on a NEW port            ← old child keeps serving on old port
        │
        ▼
wait for NEW child READINESS (HTTP /ready, not just TCP)
        │
        ▼
atomic route swap: version → NEW port    ← new requests go to NEW child
        │                                   in-flight requests stay on OLD conn
        ▼
mark OLD child "draining" (out of route table, NOT killed)
        │
        ▼
poll OLD child in-flight count until 0  OR  VERSIOND_DRAIN_TIMEOUT
        │
        ▼
SIGTERM OLD child  → wait (long grace) → SIGKILL only as last resort
```

At the proxy layer this is already graceful: `proxy.Handler` builds a
`httputil.ReverseProxy` **per request** and dials the target named in the route
table at that moment. A request that already started keeps its own connection to
the old child until it completes; only *new* requests observe the swapped route.
The only thing we must change is: **stop killing the old child immediately**.

### 1.2 Storage prerequisite (must resolve first)

Rolling update means old + new `devshardd` run **concurrently**. That only
works when durable state lives in a **shared external database** (Postgres in a
separate process). **SQLite is not supported** for rolling update.

- **Postgres** (`PGHOST` + related `PG*` env): session store (`devshard/storage`),
  payloads, and validation leases are multi-writer and shared — safe for
  overlap. Validation leases dedupe duplicate validation across instances.
- **SQLite** (`devshard/storage` under `cfg.DataDir`): single-writer file.
  Two `devshardd` processes opening the same data dir will contend / corrupt.
  Do not enable blue/green drain without Postgres.

**Requirement:** point every child at the same external Postgres before enabling
this plan. Single-instance / local dev without overlap may keep using SQLite;
see `devshard/docs/storage-design.md` (storage-mode selection) and
`devshard/docs/release-0.2.13-v2-r2.md` (HA ⇒ Postgres).

### 1.3 devshardd changes

1. **Readiness endpoint** `GET /ready` (distinct from `/healthz`):
   - returns `200` only after chain runtime is connected, host manager has
     recovered sessions, store is started, and the listener is accepting.
   - returns `503` until then.
   - This is what versiond gates the route swap on (replaces the TCP-only
     `waitForPort`).

2. **Drain/idle endpoint** `GET /drain/status` (or reuse metrics):
   - returns active in-flight count (sum of `devshard_inflight` stages plus open
     long-lived streams). versiond polls this to decide the old child is idle.
   - Optionally `POST /drain` to flip the child into "reject new, finish
     existing" mode as a belt-and-braces measure (route is already swapped, so
     new traffic shouldn't arrive, but this guards retries/direct hits).

3. **Honor a long shutdown grace.** Replace the hard 5s in `app.go` with a
   configurable `DEVSHARD_SHUTDOWN_GRACE` (default large enough for max
   inference, e.g. 10m). On `SIGTERM`, stop accepting new requests but let
   in-flight ones finish up to the grace window.

   ```306:310:devshard/cmd/devshardd/app.go
   	shutdownCtx, shutdownCancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
   	defer shutdownCancel()
   	_ = a.server.Shutdown(shutdownCtx)
   ```
   → make `5*time.Second` come from config.

### 1.4 versiond changes

#### a) Allow two children per version name

Today `Manager.processes` is `map[string]*child` (one child per name). Introduce
a notion of `current` (serving) + `draining` children so a name can have both
during a swap. Minimal shape:

- keep `processes map[string]*child` for the **serving** child (route table key),
- add `draining []*child` (or `map[string][]*child`) for children that have been
  taken out of the route table but are still finishing work.

`rebuildRoutes` already only emits running children; ensure draining children are
**excluded** from the route table (they keep their port but receive no new
traffic).

```653:661:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
func (m *Manager) rebuildRoutes() {
	routes := make(map[string]string)
	for _, c := range m.processes {
		if c.status == statusRunning {
			routes[c.version.Name] = fmt.Sprintf("localhost:%d", c.port)
		}
	}
	m.routes.Store(routes)
}
```

#### b) New child gets a NEW port

`assignPort` currently returns a **stable** port per name, which forces overlap
onto the same port. For a swap, allocate a fresh port for the incoming child so
old and new coexist; release the old port after the old child fully exits.

```60:71:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
func (m *Manager) assignPort(name string) int {
	if port, ok := m.assignedPorts[name]; ok {
		return port
	}
	port := m.nextPort
	m.nextPort++
	m.assignedPorts[name] = port
	return port
}
```
→ add a swap-aware allocation (e.g. `assignSwapPort(name)`) that returns a new
port even when `name` already has one, and a `releasePort` on drain completion.

#### c) Readiness gate instead of TCP-accept

Replace/augment `waitForPort` with an HTTP readiness probe against the new
child's `/ready`, with timeout `VERSIOND_READY_TIMEOUT`. Only mark the new child
`running` (and thus routable) once `/ready` returns `200`.

```631:649:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
func waitForPort(ctx context.Context, port int, timeout time.Duration) bool {
	...
		conn, err := net.DialTimeout("tcp", addr, 200*time.Millisecond)
		if err == nil {
			conn.Close()
			return true
		}
	...
}
```
→ add `waitForReady(ctx, port, path, timeout)` doing an HTTP GET on `/ready`.

#### d) Rewrite `downloadAndSwap` as blue/green + drain

New flow (replaces lines 392–419):

```text
1. downloadBinary(new sha)                      // old child untouched in memory
2. newChild = startChild(version, NEW port)   // same PGHOST / shared Postgres
3. if !waitForReady(newChild, VERSIOND_READY_TIMEOUT):
        stop newChild; keep old serving; abort swap (retry next poll)
4. lock: move old child from processes -> draining[name]
         set processes[name] = newChild (status running)
         rebuildRoutes()        // route now points to NEW port
   unlock
5. go drainOld(oldChild):
        deadline = now + VERSIOND_DRAIN_TIMEOUT
        loop every VERSIOND_DRAIN_POLL_INTERVAL:
            if inflight(oldChild) == 0: break
            if now > deadline: log warn; break
        oldChild.cancel()                       // SIGTERM, long WaitDelay
        waitForChild(oldChild, VERSIOND_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE)
        release oldChild port
```

Key invariants this enforces:

- **New ready before traffic:** route is swapped only after `/ready` is `200`
  (step 3–4).
- **Route new requests to new:** step 4 atomic route swap.
- **Old finishes in-flight:** step 5 waits for `inflight == 0` before any
  signal; the proxy keeps existing requests on the old connection meanwhile.
- **Don't kill until idle:** `SIGTERM` is sent only after idle or the safety
  `VERSIOND_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`.

#### e) `child` status + lifetimes

Add `statusDraining` to the status enum and surface it in `/healthz` (`Status()`
output) so operators can observe a drain in progress.

```77:89:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
func (m *Manager) Status() []health.StatusEntry {
	...
	for _, c := range m.processes {
		out = append(out, health.StatusEntry{Name: c.version.Name, Port: c.port, Status: c.status})
	}
	return out
}
```
→ also iterate `draining[...]` so draining children appear in `/healthz`.

#### f) Graceful supervisor shutdown

`Manager.Shutdown` waits 10s per child. When versiond itself is being stopped,
draining children should also get the long grace (or at least be `SIGTERM`'d and
waited on with `VERSIOND_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE`).

```492:509:versioned/internal/process/manager.go
func (m *Manager) Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error {
	...
	for _, c := range children {
		waitForChild(c, 10*time.Second)
	}
	return nil
}
```

### 1.5 New configuration (versiond `config.Config`)

Add to `versioned/internal/config/config.go`:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VERSIOND_READY_PATH` | `/ready` | devshardd readiness path the supervisor probes |
| `VERSIOND_READY_TIMEOUT` | `60s` | max wait for new child to become ready before aborting swap |
| `VERSIOND_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` | `15m` | max time to wait for old child to go idle before `SIGTERM` |
| `VERSIOND_DRAIN_POLL_INTERVAL` | `2s` | how often to poll old child in-flight count |
| `VERSIOND_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE` | `30s` | wait after `SIGTERM` before `SIGKILL` |

And on the child side: `DEVSHARD_SHUTDOWN_GRACE` (default `10m`) consumed in
`app.go`.

> Note: `cmd.WaitDelay = 5s` in `runChild` will `SIGKILL` the child 5s after
> context cancel regardless of the devshardd grace. For drained children, set
> `WaitDelay` to `VERSIOND_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE` (or `0`/disabled) so the child's own
> graceful shutdown can complete.

### 1.6 Single-instance limits (be honest)

Even with blue/green + drain inside **one** versiond:

- The window is **one swap per version name at a time** — fine for "same name,
  new binary".
- Escrows already mapped to the old child stay there until they finish; new
  escrows go to the new child. With a single versiond there is no consistent
  hashing, so **all new requests** go to the new child after the swap — which is
  exactly what we want for a binary rollout.

### 1.7 Two drain layers (do not conflate)

Part 1 (§1.1–§1.6) and `versiond-router` drain solve **different events** at
**different layers**. They are not substitutes for each other.

| Event | Who handles drain | Router involved? |
|---|---|---|
| Same version **name**, new **sha256** (governance binary update) | **versiond** blue/green + devshardd child drain (§1.1) | **No** — versiond stays up on `:8080`; only the devshardd child swaps |
| **versiond host** removal, replacement, or supervisor upgrade | **`versiond-router`** (or K8s Service — Part 2) | **Yes** — whole process/container leaves the pool |

During a devshardd binary swap, sticky routing is unchanged:

```text
versiond-router → versiond-2:8080   (same upstream throughout)
                      └─ versiond proxy: old devshardd :9001 → new :9002
```

The router never sees the child swap. **Do not** remove a versiond upstream from
the router pool for a governance sha change — that would unnecessarily evacuate
every escrow pinned to that host. In-versiond drain (§1.1) is the correct tool
for binary rollout.

Router drain is only needed when the **versiond process itself** must stop
(restart, replace, scale-down, host maintenance, versiond binary upgrade). Killing
versiond kills its in-process proxy and all devshardd children regardless of
§1.1 drain logic.

### 1.8 versiond-router: draining versiond hosts (HA)

When N versiond instances sit behind `versiond-router` (nginx consistent hash on
escrow ID — see `versiond-router/nginx.conf.template`), **removal or replacement
of a versiond host** must be managed at the router layer. This is a separate
operational track from §1.1; it does not replace and is not required for
devshardd binary swaps.

Today `versiond-router` only renders a static upstream list from `VERSIOND_HOSTS`
(`versiond-router/entrypoint.sh`). It has **no drain support** — that must be
added (or handled by an operator runbook until automated).

#### Target flow (evacuate one versiond host)

Applies when taking `versiond-N` out of service: container replace, supervisor
upgrade, scale-down, or decommission.

```text
1. Mark versiond-N down in router upstream (reload nginx config)
        │  → no NEW requests hashed to versiond-N
        │  → in-flight connections to versiond-N keep running
        ▼
2. Poll versiond-N until idle:
        GET versiond-N:8080/healthz  (no draining children, or all idle)
        and/or aggregate devshardd GET /drain/status on that host
        loop until inflight == 0  OR  ROUTER_DRAIN_TIMEOUT
        ▼
3. Graceful stop versiond-N:
        SIGTERM versiond  →  versiond.Shutdown waits on children (§1.4f)
        wait up to ROUTER_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE  →  SIGKILL only as backstop
        ▼
4. Kill process / free machine:
        stop container or release VM; remove from VERSIOND_HOSTS; reload router
        (or leave marked down if host is gone permanently)
        ▼
5. (Replacement only) Start new versiond-N, wait until healthy, re-add upstream
```

Key invariants:

- **Stop new traffic first:** router marks the upstream `down` (or removes it)
  before any `SIGTERM` to versiond. Consistent hash means escrows already on
  `versiond-N` cannot fail over to another replica — that instance must drain
  its pinned escrows before exit.
- **Drain before kill:** do not free the machine until step 2 reports idle (or
  the safety timeout fires with an operator-visible warning).
- **One host at a time:** with `N−1` replicas still in the pool, other escrows
  keep serving while one host evacuates.

#### What to build (router track)

| Piece | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Upstream `down` / removal + `nginx -s reload` | Stop routing new escrows to the host being evacuated |
| `ROUTER_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` | Max wait for a host to go idle before forced stop |
| `ROUTER_DRAIN_POLL_INTERVAL` | How often to poll versiond `/healthz` and devshardd `/drain/status` |
| `ROUTER_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE` | Wait after `SIGTERM` to versiond before `SIGKILL` / container kill |
| Operator script or sidecar | Orchestrate steps 1–4; re-render `VERSIOND_HOSTS` and reload |

Re-use the devshardd endpoints from §1.3 (`/ready`, `/drain/status`) and
versiond `/healthz` draining visibility from §1.4e — implement them once; the
router track consumes the same signals.

#### When to use which layer

- **Governance publishes new sha256 for an existing name** → §1.1 only (every
  versiond reconciles independently; router unchanged).
- **Replace or remove a versiond host** → §1.8 only (router drain, then kill).
- **Both at once** (e.g. new devshardd binary *and* new versiond supervisor on
  the same machine) → §1.1 swap first while the host stays in the pool, *then*
  §1.8 if the host itself must leave; or evacuate via §1.8 and start fresh on
  a new host (coarser, acceptable for maintenance windows).

Part 2 (K8s) maps the same host-evacuation semantics onto Service endpoints +
`preStop` instead of nginx reload; it is the same layer as §1.8, not §1.1.

### 1.9 Test plan

- **Unit (`versioned/internal/process`):** extend `manager_test.go` with a swap
  scenario asserting: old child still routed/alive until new `/ready`; route
  points to new port after readiness; old child not `SIGTERM`'d until inflight
  reports 0; old killed at `VERSIOND_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`.
- **e2e (`versioned/e2e`):** drive a long request against the old child, trigger
  an oracle sha change for the same name, assert the long request completes with
  the old binary while a concurrently-started request is served by the new one.
- **devshardd:** test `/ready` flips only after init; `/drain/status` reflects
  `devshard_inflight`; `SIGTERM` honors `DEVSHARD_SHUTDOWN_GRACE`.

### 1.10 Rollout order

**Track A — devshardd binary swap (§1.1–§1.6, required for governance updates):**

1. devshardd: `/ready`, `/drain/status`, configurable shutdown grace.
2. versiond: config flags (no behavior change yet).
3. versiond: per-name two-child model + swap-aware ports + readiness probe.
4. versiond: rewrite `downloadAndSwap` to blue/green + drain.
5. Surface draining state in `/healthz`; long `WaitDelay` for drained children.
6. Tests (§1.9), then enable by default.

**Track B — versiond host removal/replacement (§1.8, HA only):**

7. versiond-router: upstream `down` + reload; drain poll loop; operator script
   or sidecar for graceful stop → kill → free machine → re-add on replace.
8. Tests: long request pinned to `versiond-N`; mark upstream down; assert
   request completes; assert no new requests arrive; assert process exit after idle.

---

## Part 2 — Kubernetes deployment (non-detailed)

The same three guarantees map cleanly onto native K8s primitives; the goal is to
let the platform do drain/readiness and keep `devshardd`/`versiond` stateless
enough to be rescheduled.

### 2.1 Shape

- Run `devshardd` (or `versiond`+`devshardd`) as a `Deployment` behind a
  `Service`. Shared Postgres stays external (multi-writer, as today).
- Put a **sticky** layer in front for escrow affinity: either the existing
  `versiond-router` pattern (nginx consistent hash on escrow ID) or an
  ingress / service mesh with consistent hashing on the escrow path segment.
- **Pod/host evacuation** (Part 1 §1.8) maps to Service endpoint removal +
  `preStop` below — not to the in-versiond devshardd binary swap in §1.1.

### 2.2 Rolling update strategy

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0   # never drop capacity
    maxSurge: 1         # bring new pod up first
```

- `maxUnavailable: 0` + `maxSurge: 1` → new pod is created and must pass
  readiness **before** an old pod is removed (new ready before traffic).

### 2.3 Readiness + drain

- **readinessProbe** → `GET /ready` on devshardd. Endpoints only include a pod
  once it is truly ready; new traffic flows to the new pod automatically.
- **terminationGracePeriodSeconds**: large (cover max inference, e.g. minutes)
  so in-flight requests can finish after the pod is told to stop.
- **preStop hook**: fail readiness / `sleep` so the pod is removed from Service
  endpoints **before** `SIGTERM`, then let in-flight requests drain. devshardd's
  configurable shutdown grace (`DEVSHARD_SHUTDOWN_GRACE`) must be ≤
  `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`.

```text
new pod created → readinessProbe 200 → added to Service endpoints
old pod: preStop (drop from endpoints + sleep) → SIGTERM → finish in-flight
         → exits before terminationGracePeriodSeconds → SIGKILL only as backstop
```

### 2.4 State considerations

- **Postgres required** for rolling update (same as Part 1 §1.2): session store,
  payloads, and validation leases must live in shared external Postgres so old
  and new pods can overlap safely. SQLite is not supported for pod replacement
  with concurrent overlap.
- Keep pods otherwise stateless: `cfg.DataDir` holds only routing markers
  (e.g. `.pg-bound`), not session data.

### 2.5 What carries over from Part 1

- devshardd `/ready` + `/drain` + configurable shutdown grace are the **same**
  building blocks K8s probes and hooks consume — implement them once for both.
- The drain/idle accounting (`devshard_inflight`) feeds the versiond binary-swap
  drain loop (§1.1), the versiond-router host-evacuation loop (§1.8), and K8s
  preStop logic / dashboards.
- §1.1 (binary swap inside a live versiond) and §1.8 / this section (whole
  pod/host removal) remain separate: K8s `RollingUpdate` handles pod lifecycle;
  versiond `downloadAndSwap` handles governance sha changes without pod restart.

### 2.6 Not in scope here

- Helm/manifests, HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, mesh config — to be detailed when
  the K8s track is picked up. This section only fixes the rollout **semantics**
  so they match the versiond behavior.
